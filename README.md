# What is it?
IVOA Data Model for WCS Transforms, covering the following concepts:
  • The description of mathematical operations which form the building blocks for conversions from one coordinate space to another.
  • The combination of individual operations into an arbitrarily complex Transform.
  
This model makes use of the [Astronomical Coordinates and Coordinate Systems](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/Coords/20200310/index.html) model for the description of the end point coordinate systems.
